# Motorola 68000 Homebrew Computer Project

Welcome to the **My Motorola 68000 Homebrew Computer Project** repository! This project is a personal endeavour to build a fully custom computer from the ground up using the Motorola 68000 CPU, alongside a range of memory and I/O components. This repository contains all source code, schematics, and documentation to help you understand and replicate this classic hardware-based build.

## üìú Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a working computer around the Motorola 68000 processor, featuring:

- A custom **bootloader** and **Power-On Self Test (POST)** for hardware validation.
- **Custom OS** development with support for a variety of vintage applications.
- Complete **I/O handling** through UART, SPI, and I2C, with a focus on optimised device control.
- **Memory management** and **address decoding** to fully utilise 4MB ROM and 4MB RAM.
- Support for classic peripherals, including **MOD-VGA** for video output, SD card storage, and LCD display.


## üéØ Features

- **Assembly Bootloader**: Initialises hardware and performs POST checks.
- **Custom OS and Monitor Program**: Basic OS functionality with a WozMon-style monitor for low-level control.
- **Peripheral Integration**: Handles UART communication, LCD output, SPI and I2C devices.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Configured to manage multiple peripherals through hardware interrupts.
- **I/O Libraries**: Developed in assembly for efficient control over UART, SPI, and I2C.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Components

Key components in the build include:

- **Motorola 68000 CPU** (TS68000CP8)
- **W65C22N6TPG VIA**: General I/O, SPI, and I2C handling.
- **M82C51A UART**: For serial communication with RS-232 support.
- **SST39SF040 and AS6C4008-55PCN**: ROM and RAM, respectively, for memory storage.
- **MOD-VGA**: Video output over VGA.
- **Various Decoders, AND Gates, and Custom Reset Circuitry**

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Cross-compiler for Motorola 68000**: Use the GCC toolchain for M68K.
- **GNU Make**: To handle the build process.
- **Soldering and Perfboard Assembly**: Required for the hardware build.

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rdearman/my_m68k.git
   cd my_m68k
   ```

2. **Build the source code**:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```

3. **Load the bootloader and OS** to the ROM chips:
   - For detailed steps on flashing the ROM, refer to the [Setup Guide](docs/Setup.md). (TBD)

4. **To use with emulator instead**:
   ```bash
   qemu-system-m68k -M virt -m 8M -kernel bin/bootloader.elf -serial stdio -s -S 
   ```

### Running the System

- **Power on the system** with the ROM and RAM installed.
- The bootloader will perform a POST, followed by OS initialisation.

## Memory Map

This section defines the memory layout for the Motorola 68000 homebrew computer project, detailing the locations of RAM, ROM, stack, and memory-mapped I/O devices.

| Multiplexer Output | Address Range / Device            | Description                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Y1 (0x10000000)`        | D43256C (RAM)                    | Lower RAM device                                 |
| `Y2 (0x20000000)`        | W65C22N6TPG (VIA Chip) CS1       | First chip select for VIA                        |
| `Y3 (0x20000000)`        | W65C22N6TPG (VIA Chip) CS2       | Second chip select for VIA                       |
| `Y4 (0x40000000)`        | M82C51A (UART) WR                | Write line for UART                              |

| Address Range        | Description                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `0x00000000` - `0x000FFFFF` | **ROM** - Bootloader, OS, and monitor program |
| `0x00100000` - `0x001FFFFF` | **RAM** - General-purpose RAM for program data |
| `0x00200000`               | **Stack Top** - Top of the stack |
| `0xC00000`                 | **UART Base** - M82C51A memory-mapped address |
| `0xC00020`                 | **SPI Base** - SPI peripheral interface |

### Notes
- **ROM** holds the bootloader, OS, and monitor programs, occupying the first 1MB.
- **RAM** is in the next 1MB for general program data.
- **Stack Top** is located at `0x200000`.
- **VIA Chip**: Accessed via CS1 and CS2 lines, allowing for multiple chip select options for expanded I/O capabilities.
- **UART (M82C51A)**: Separate read (`Y5`) and write (`Y4`) lines for controlled data access.
- **Data Bus Transceiver (CD74HCT245P)**: Controlled via `Y6` to manage data direction between the CPU and peripherals.

This detailed map provides a clear structure of memory addresses and device-specific mappings, critical for understanding address space and device handling.
